//        Assume that word is a String variable and already has a value.
//Write a statement to display the message "Today's Word-Of-The-Day is: " followed by the value of word.
//The message and the value of word should appear together, on  a single line.
//
//Ex:
//
//Today's Word-Of-The-Day is:Java

//        Instructions from your teacher:
//first and second are already declared and given values.
//Write a single statement that will print the message "first is " followed by the value of first, and then a space, followed by "second = ", followed by the value of second.
//
//Ex:
//
//first is 55 second = 123

        //Instructions from your teacher:
        //Given an integer variable i and a floating-point variable f, that have already been given values, write a statement that writes both of their values to console in the following format:
        //
        //i=value-of-i f=value-of-f
        //
        //Ex:
        //Assume i = 9 and f = 33.4
        //
        //Output should be:
        //i=9 f=33.4



        //Five friends are going to the theater. They have purchased a row of five seats with an aisle on either end.

        //James wants to sit on the aisle
        //Provide a seating order that conforms to the above rules. An example of an invalid seating order is:
        //James, Betty, Herb, Bob, Jill
        //
        //The above arrangement is invalid because: Bob is not sitting on left aisle.
        //
        //Specify the seating order as the names separated by commas and a space (as in the above example).  Use variables and print names in the right order.

//        Instructions from your teacher:
//        2 String variables are already declared and assigned values.
//        They will hold different programming language names.
//
//                Using those variables print the message exactly like below.
//
//        Ex:
//        Assume lan1 = "Java" and lan2 = "SQL"
//
//        You need to print exactly:
//
//        I will learn "Java" and "SQL" at CybertekSchool.

        //System.out.println("I will learn " + "\"" + lan1 + "\"" + " and " + "\"" + lan2 + "\"" +
              //  " at CybertekSchool.");

//        Declare an byte variable named steps and assign 100

//        Declare an int variable named count and assign 1000000
//        Declare an long variable named population and assign 3434455667
//
//        public class Main {
//  public static void main(String[] args) {
//    //WRITE YOUR CODE HERE:
//
//    byte steps=100;
//    short miles=5000;
//    int count = 1000000;
//    long population=3434455667l;
