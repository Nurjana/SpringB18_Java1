There are three main types of methods: interface methods, constructor methods, and implementation methods.
 Most beginner programmers are familiar with implementation methods.

public static boolean validateTask(boolean notEmpty, int taskId, int currentId) {
        Boolean result = true;
        {condition}
        return result;
    }
