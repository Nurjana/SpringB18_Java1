Interface is the blue print of the class, means it is used to specify the behavior that class needs to implement
-used for achieving abstraction
-keyword interface has to be used when creating a class:
        public interface name{}
- main purpose is to achieve abstraction
-you have to create an abstract method in interface class
-create an interface class can be done directly when creating a class by choosing not Java class as usual, but selecting interface
-in interface you are  creating an abstract method without specifying its abstract
-public access modifier is given by default
-interface will not accept protected, private
-when using interface class as a super class, we call it super type
 inheritance will be through key word "implements" instead of extends

 Why do we need interface:
 A class can ingerit from ONE class only (extends)
 A class can inherit  multiple interfaces (implements)

what we have in interface
-variables static and final
-methods

what we cannot have in interface
-constructor
instance variable
instance method
instance block
static block
