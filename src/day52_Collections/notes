Data structure: in order to manage data efficiently and in organized manner:
                -Array
                -Collections
                -Map

Array:
        -size is fixed
        -supports primitives and objects
        -can be multi-dimentional
        -has index and accepts duplicates

Collections frameworl:
        -iported from Java util package
        -consist of multiple interfaces


ITERABLE: root interface, su[er type of all interfaces in collections framework

Collections:
        -size is dynamic
        -cannot store primitives and can be  multi-dimentional
